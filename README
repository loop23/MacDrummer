Is a playground to investigate novel uses of the trackpad as an
expressive musical instrument. The idea is to have it behave like a
djembe or darbouka, but maybe even hang, so that touches in different
positions, or the speed at which fingers release the pad after a hit
change the sound, or by using certain parts of the trackpad as sound
modifiers. The first version is going to use OSC to have sound generated
by something else like PD or Max/msp, since the AudioUnits API seemed
a bit intimidating.

= Notes =

This is my first osx app. It doesn't yet generate OSC messages, but if
you run it and tap on the trackpad you get to know in the app log how
far you did tap from the center.  Not a big start, but that's
something!

= Licence =

I still have to decide, probably MIT or GPL; At the moment it's so
dumb that it can safely be assumed to be in the public domain.

= Thanks =

I'm using http://code.google.com/p/vvopensource/ to handle OSC.
Thank you!
